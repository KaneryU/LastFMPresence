# Last.fm Rich Presence
This applications allows what you're currently listening to be shown on you Discord profile. All it takes is a Last.fm account, and a scrobbler that updates your profile's currently playing song.

## Installation
Grab the latest release EXE from the releases tab, or you can download the code and run from source. The source code option is cross platform, as all it requires is Python 3.12 or higher and PySide6. Cross platform installers are coming soon.

## Usage
Simply launch the application (It will also auto-run at system start up). If you're running from source, the application will not automatically run at startup, and you will have to make those arrangements yourself.
